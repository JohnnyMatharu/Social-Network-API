Every user can post a new thought and every thought is re-assigned the userId to become the thoughtId. CRUD operations can be performed on Thoughts as well. Reactions can be posted to every thought and similar CRUD operations can be performed on Reactions based on ReactionId. 

This application uses NPM, Mongoose, Express, Mongoose Validator, and Mongoose Seeder
